# Health Care by the Numbers
**This is the GitHub repository for [healthcarebythenumbers.com](https://www.healthcarebythenumbers.com)**

This web app makes it easy to find out which groups lack health care throughout each of the 50 states in the USA. Each state lists the top 10 uninsured characteristics based on 2017 American Community Surveys (ACS) data which was also used to develop a prediction model for the health care insurance calculator.

The prediction calculator uses a **Logistic Regression** model.
